## About this project üí°

- Noty Android app is available with _traditional approach using Navigation Architecture_ as well as modern UI development toolkit i.e. _Jetpack Compose UI_.
- There are two submodules in [**`app`**](/app) module as following:
    - [**`:app:simpleapp`**](app/simpleapp): Android Noty UI implementation using [_Navigation Architecture_](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) using traditional XML resources.
    - [**`:app:composeapp`**](app/composeapp): Android Noty UI implementation using [_Jetpack Compose UI Toolkit_](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KKRX0vsRWcQ-0AC6lCutEWwAB4t1wqWBi2MclQqm96gnSddahFRdkAaArbwEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) with Kotlin ‚ù§Ô∏è.

In Android Studio, just run the application as you want with any one of the module from above.

## Development Setup üñ•

You will require latest Canary version of Android Studio 4.2 or newer to be able to build the app. Download latest Canary release from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview).

## Design / Wireframes ‚ú®

Design of this awesome application is implemented by [Sanju S](https://github.com/Spikeysanju). You can see design below.

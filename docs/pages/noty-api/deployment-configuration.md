# 🧰 Deployment Configuration

Need to configure project to be able to deploy on Heroku.

## Set up configuration files

- Create [`app.json`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/NotyKT/blob/master/noty-api/app.json) in the root directory of the project and add content as below.

```json
{
  "name": "Noty API",
  "description": "The API for Noty",
  "image": "heroku/java",
  "addons": [
    "heroku-postgresql"
  ]
}
```

- Create a [`system.properties`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/NotyKT/blob/master/noty-api/system.properties) file describing your java version:

```properties
java.runtime.version=11
```

## Define Gradle Task

Whenever deployment is triggered on Heroku, it executes Gradle task - `stage` which will be responsible for project build generation and then deployment. So declare a Gradle task in [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/NotyKT/blob/master/noty-api/application/build.gradle)

```gradle
task stage {
    dependsOn installDist
}
```

!> If this is not configured then you can face the error generated by heroku at the time of deployment.

## Set up `Procfile`

You will also need a [`Procfile`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/NotyKT/blob/master/noty-api/Procfile) describing what to execute at the time of deployment.

As we set up Gradle task in previous step, whenever Gradle task `stage` is executed, built application artifacts are generated at the path `application/build/install/application/bin/application`. In the Procfile, just provide the name of the process and the generated executable file.

```Procfile
web: application/build/install/application/bin/application
```

Okay, It's time to test deployment locally.

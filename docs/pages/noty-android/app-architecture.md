# üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture

This app uses [MVVM (Model View View-Model)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

In this, each component depends only on the component one level below it. For example, activities and fragments depend only on a view model. The repository is the only class that depends on multiple other classes; in this example, the repository depends on a persistent data model and a remote backend data source.

This design creates a consistent and pleasant user experience. Regardless of whether the user comes back to the app several minutes after they've last closed it or several days later, they instantly see a user's information that the app persists locally. If this data is stale, the app's repository module starts updating the data in the background.

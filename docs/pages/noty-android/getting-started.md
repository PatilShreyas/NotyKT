This is mobile application using which actual users will interact with. The application is developed using Modern tools/libraries with UI implementations with Navigation architecture as well as Modern UI development toolkit i.e. Jetpack Compose.

It connects with the Noty REST API to save and retrieve data.

## üìô Overview of Codebase

This is Gradle based multi-module project having modules as following:

### Application (`app`)

This is the main Android application module which include Android specific features or code.

It has two submodules as:

- **Simple Application (`simpleapp`):** UI implementation using [_Navigation Architecture_](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) using traditional XML resources.

- **JetPack Compose Application (`composeapp`) _(WIP)_:** UI implementation using [_Jetpack Compose UI Toolkit_](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KKRX0vsRWcQ-0AC6lCutEWwAB4t1wqWBi2MclQqm96gnSddahFRdkAaArbwEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

### Core (`core`)

Pure JVM module consist of utilities, interfaces and base boilerplate.

### Data (`data`)

This is a data source for the application. It has two sub-modules as following.

- **Local Data (`local`):** Persistent storage of data using Room (SQLite) database.

- **Remote Data(`remote`):** Network layer implemented using Retrofit.

### Repository (`repository`)

For single source of data. Implements `local` and `remote` modules.

### ViewModel (`viewmodel`)

ViewModel implementation. Used `repository` for source of data.

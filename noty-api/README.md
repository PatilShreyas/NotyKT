# NotyKT (API)

![Build (API)](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/NotyKT/workflows/Build%20(API)/badge.svg)

Noty backend _REST API_ is built with Ktor framework with PostgreSQL as database and deployed on the [Railway](https://railway.app).

Currently this API is deployed on _`https://notykt-production.up.railway.app`. You can try it ðŸ˜ƒ.

[ðŸ“„ _**Visit the documentation of this project**_](https://patilshreyas.github.io/NotyKT/) to get more information in detail.

## Features ðŸ‘“

- Easy structure
- Authentication
- Automatic and easy deployment to Railway.app
- Test cases

## About this Project ðŸ’¡

This project has two modules as following:

- **`data`**: Data source and operations.
- **`application`**: Ktor application entry point and API routes.

## Development Setup ðŸ–¥

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

You will require latest stable version of JetBrains IntelliJ Idea to build and run the server application.

- Import this project in IntelliJ Idea
- Build the project.
- Set environment variables for the `:application:run` configuration as following

_Refer to the [`.env`](.env) file for example of environment variables._

```
SECRET_KEY=ANY_RANDOM_SECRET_VALUE

PGPORT=5432
PGHOST=localhost
PGDATABASE=notykt_dev_db
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=postgres

DATABASE_DRIVER=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource
DATABASE_MAX_POOL_SIZE=10
```

Replace database credentials with your local config.

- Run command `./gradlew :application:run`.
- Hit `http://localhost:8080` and API will be liveðŸ”¥.
- You can find sample HTTP requests [here](http/) and can directly send requests from IntelliJ itself.

### Using Docker

You can also use Docker to run the application and its dependencies. This is the recommended approach for a consistent 
development environment.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine

#### Steps to run with Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the required environment variables (see example above)
4. Run the following command to start the application and database:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- NotyKT API application on port 8080

To run the services in the background, use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To rebuild the application after making changes:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

You can access the API at `http://localhost:8080` once the services are up and running.
